              1. By participating in the 100% First Deposit Bonus promotion
              (hereinafter – Promotion), you confirm that you have read and
              accepted the terms and conditions.

              deposit amount to get the bonus is 4 500 NGN.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. The bonus can be activated after the first deposit has been
              made, provided that all the personal data fields in your personal
              account have been filled out and your phone number has been
              activated.

              will be revoked.
            </p>
            <p>
              6. The bonus must be wagered with a bet, the amount of which does
              not exceed the amount of the bonus. If the bet will exceed the
              amount of funds in the bonus account, the entire amount of the bet
              will be debited from the main account.

            <p>
              8. The amount that the player must place to fulfill the conditions
              of the bonus is counted only after all bets made in that amount
              have been calculated. Bets that have been refunded do not count
              toward the wagering.
            </p>
            <p>
              9. Withdrawal of funds is not possible until the conditions of the

              10. The player can withdraw an amount from 0 to the total amount
              of deposits if the balance remains at least twice the amount of
              the bonus (the withdrawal of the amount of winnings and the amount
              of bonus is not provided).

            <p>
              12. The entire amount of the bonus must be redeemed before funds
              can be withdrawn from the account (or before they can be
              transferred to the casino), otherwise, any bonuses or winnings
              made therewith will be forfeited.
            </p>
            <p>
              13. The wagered bonus is credited to a customer's account as the
              remaining bonus funds and cannot exceed the initial bonus amount.
              If the wagering bonus account balance is less than the amount of
              the minimum bet the bonus will be deemed to have been lost.
